## 10/5/2025 - Learned about what CYDs are and what they are capable of.  

Cheap Yellow Displays, or CYDs, are cheap ESP32-powered touch screens with a ton of awesome features, such as WiFi and Bluetooth. Found them in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fd6wm8f14&t=242s. I learned more about them here: https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display. Scrolled through some Reddit posts, and found that they are super reliable, with some Redditors saying they have been using them for more than one year. Watched this YT video at 2x speed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agfuTNZGGl4. 

I actually love this so much. I could make this into a macropad, a Spotify Car Thing clone, a weather display, a handheld gaming device, and so much more! But first, I think I'll make a smart pill organizer for the Congressional App Challenge. ![Screenshot 2025-10-05 at 2.53.23â€¯PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjUwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d05580e5de399fc37464d5c762e4a2c66ddc9419/Screenshot%202025-10-05%20at%202.53.23%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 10/6/2025 - Began CAD + Ordered Parts  

I have decided to buy the https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4KSKW96. It uses capacitive touch, which seems like it's wayyyyy better than capacitive touch. I found this: https://www.printables.com/model/739905-cyd-35-case-esp32-3248s035/, but extended it a little bit to make sure the speaker fits. Speaking of the speaker, I chose this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0826551ZZ, because it can fit inside the case.

When I get the parts, I'll probably add branding to the CAD and customize it more.
